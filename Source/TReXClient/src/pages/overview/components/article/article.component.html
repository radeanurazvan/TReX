            PHP has become one of the workhorses of the internet due to its power and flexibility. In this article, Dr. Michael Garbade introduces us to and reviews three PHP frameworks: Symfony, Laravel, and Yii. Frameworks are an almost essential tool for those sites that by their nature require frequent updates and interaction with databases.

            All three use templating systems to allow for the creation of PHP code for customized layouts and structures for various web pages, while minimizing the setup work. Dr. Garbade points out the advantages of each framework's approach in terms of flexibility, speed, database utilization, and extensibility. Although he couldn't recommend an overall winner in all of these categories, each framework has its strong points, depending on your needs.
